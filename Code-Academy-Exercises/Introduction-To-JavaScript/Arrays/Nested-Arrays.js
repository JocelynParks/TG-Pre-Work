const numberClusters = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];

//Nested arrays is essentially arrays stored within other arrays. We can represent this in code by placing [] within []. The exercise wanted "6", so you count the brackets, 0,1,2 (6 is in 2), and then 5,6 is 0,1 so the numbers you want are [2] and [1]
