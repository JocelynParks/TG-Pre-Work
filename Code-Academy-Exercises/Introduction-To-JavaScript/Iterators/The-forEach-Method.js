const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];
// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(`I want to eat a ${fruits}.`))


//.forEach() loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. The forEach() will always be undefined. You may also use => to represent forEach. When this was ran it read "I want to eat a a,b,c,d" four times.
