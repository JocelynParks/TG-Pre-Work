var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = `You can make carbonara with" + pasta + meat +, and a sauce made with + sauce +.`;
//The version ES6 is used for three reasons: similarity to other programming languages, readability and economy of code, and addresses sources of ES5 bugs. In this proplem, I change all the variables to var (let and const are ES6 code). Also (+) signs were used to interpolerate variables.
