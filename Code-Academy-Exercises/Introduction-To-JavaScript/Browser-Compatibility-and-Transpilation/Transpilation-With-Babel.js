var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

//So you don't have to manually change code to fit ES5 or ES6 standards, you may use Babel which will do this for you. Instal : npm install babel-cli and npm install babel-preset-env in the TERMINAL WINDOW.
