let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';
console.log(typeof newVariable);
newVariable = 1
console.log(typeof newVariable)

//Typeof operator will check the variable data types.I used typeof for a newVariable and then set it equal to 1. I then assigned it a new value thus creating a  new type.
