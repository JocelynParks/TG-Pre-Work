// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
  console.log(counter)
};
//Now we will loop in reverse. Similar to last exercise, but now set the stopping condition (use >=) for when the iterator variable is less than the desired amount. Instead of ++, use --. This assignment asked for 3 to 0.
